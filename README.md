![Design preview for the Pomodoro app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Pomodoro timer app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide a Figma design file.

For icons you can use whatever you like. DaisyUI, MaterialUI, etc.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
